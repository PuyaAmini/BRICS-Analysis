Here's how I implemented the final failure probability formula in the `calculate_failure_probability` method, explained step by step:

1. **First, I calculated three main risks**:
   ```python
   economic_risk = self.calculate_economic_risk()       # Economic risk
   political_risk = self.calculate_political_risk()     # Political risk
   governance_risk = self.calculate_governance_risk()   # Governance risk
   ```

2. **Then I calculated the final probability with this formula**:
   ```python
   overall_probability = (
       self.weights["Economic_Stability"] * economic_risk +           # 0.30 × Economic risk
       self.weights["Geopolitical_Tensions"] * political_risk +      # 0.25 × Political risk
       self.weights["Global_Economic_Environment"] * 0.5 +           # 0.20 × 0.5 (Base global risk)
       self.weights["Implementation_and_Governance"] * governance_risk # 0.25 × Governance risk
   )
   ```

In simpler terms, I considered these weights:
- 30% weight for economic risk
- 25% weight for political risk
- 20% weight for global risk (which I set as a constant 0.5)
- 25% weight for governance risk

3. **Finally, I multiplied the resulting number by 100 to convert it to a percentage**:
   ```python
   return overall_probability * 100
   ```

Therefore, I calculated the final probability as a weighted average of four main factors and then converted it to a percentage. A larger number indicates a higher probability of failure.

For example, if I have these numbers:
- Economic risk = 0.4
- Political risk = 0.6
- Global risk = 0.5 (constant)
- Governance risk = 0.3

I calculate the final probability like this:
```
(0.30 × 0.4) + (0.25 × 0.6) + (0.20 × 0.5) + (0.25 × 0.3) = 0.445
```
And after converting to percentage:
```
0.445 × 100 = 44.5%
```
